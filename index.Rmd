I'm a Cornell University alumnus, and current second-year Masters student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California Santa Barbara. Prior to Bren, I worked for The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund, Cornell University, and Epic Software Systems in positions including project management and implementation, marketing, collaborative science development, public data accessibility, and community-based fisheries management. Recently, I came to Bren to hone my marine ecology skills, as well as focus on launching my business idea, Karang, a digital network that enables information flow for coastal communities and the seafood industry. After Bren, I hope to pursue an economics PhD to investigate some of the complexities of Karang. Ultimately, I aim to use Karang to shift the incentives operating in the blue economy to support efficient, equitable, and truly sustainable management of aquatic resources.
